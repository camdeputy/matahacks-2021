            <h2>How are the calculations found?</h2>
            <p>The calculations are based on a dataset provided by <a href="https://everydayastronaut.com/rocket-pollution/">Everyday Astronaut</a>.
            Based on this source's calculations, CO2 emissions are calculated by assuming the fuel tank of each rocket is full before launch, and the
            rocket completely exhausts all fuel during flight. In order to convert the metric tonnes of CO2 emissions to our number of trees, we assume
            that a mature tree absorbs about <a href="https://www.arborday.org/trees/treefacts/">48 pounds of CO2 anually</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Technology Used</h2>
            <p>The frontend of this project consists of HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla Javascript. Data visualization, animations, and some user interaction
            is provided by Unity. We also store and interact with our data using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google Firebase</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>How does this project relate to aerospace?</h2>
            <p>We believe this project relates to aerospace because while we are strong believers of the advancement of space exploration,
            it is important to keep in mind the cost on our own planet and atmosphere. Our goal is for a user to be able to comprehend the carbon emissions
            of aerospace exploration.
