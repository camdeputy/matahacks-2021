## What is this project?
`The goal of this project was to create an application that visualized the negative impacts of rocket fuel emissions on the environment. We use Unity to develop our visualization that renders once a user picks a rocket to 'launch.' In order to accurately simulate a rocket launches impact on the climate we pulled different resouces [found under souces] to calculate a variety of different rockets co2 ouput per full tank.`

## How does this project relate to aerospace? 
`We hope this project is able to inspire future generations to begin contributing towards the fight against fuel emissions and the negative impact on our environment. `
