## What is this project?
`We have created a web application with integrated WebGL. The goal of this project was to create a vizualization of the impact of rocket fuel emissions in the atmosphere. To achieve this, we use Unity to generate the amount of trees it would take in a year to negate the effects of this rocket exhausting its entire fuel tank. We also use Unity to develop our visualization that renders once a user picks a rocket to 'launch.' In order to accurately simulate a rocket launches impact on the climate we pulled different resouces [found under sources] to calculate a variety of different rockets co2 ouput per full tank.`

<br>

## How does this project relate to aerospace? 
`We hope this project is able to inspire future generations to begin contributing towards the fight against fuel emissions and the negative impact on our environment. `

## What's next?
`Our future goals for this project is to add more data on emissions from cars, factories, etc. We also hope to port this project to AR using EchoAR.`
